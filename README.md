# 💻 node.js_modules

**A Centralized Library of Reusable Node.js Utility Modules.**
---

## ✨ Overview

This repository serves as a **centralized collection** for various custom-built, general-purpose modules and functions intended to streamline development across multiple Node.js projects.

Instead of duplicating common logic (like complex date formatting, API response standardization, or specific file I/O operations), these utilities are abstracted here for easy importing and consistent use.

### Key Features

* **Reusable Abstractions:** Solve common programming challenges once.
* **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Modules are organized logically by function (e.g., `date-utils`, `api-helpers`, `file-manager`).

## 📦 Installation

Since this is a collection of utilities, you will typically copy or integrate the specific module files you need into your project.

### Method 1: Direct File Copy (Recommended for small/internal use)

1.  Browse the `modules/` directory.
2.  Identify the specific module you need (e.g., `modules/date-utils.js`).
3.  Copy that file into your project's utility folder.

### Method 2: Git Clone (For full integration or contribution)

```bash
# Clone the repository to access all modules
git clone https://github.com/Elysium853/node.js_modules.git
